Hey there developer, welcome to the official Efficiency Label Alpha!

This application is designed to generate Australian/NZ Appliance Efficiency Labels via the web.

When the full version is complete, this app will be able to cut down on company time and money spent on generating these labels from scratch for each appliance.

To launch this app locally for testing/viewing purposes, here's what you need to do:

 1. Make sure you've activated your virtual environment if you're on Windows/MacOs.
 2. cd to inside the 'mywebsite' directory
 3. Run <code>python manage.py runserver</code>
 4. Done! The server will be live at localhost:8000/images/ .
 
 Thanks for trying Efficiency Label!
